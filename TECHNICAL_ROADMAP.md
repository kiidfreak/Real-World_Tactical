# 🎮 Real World Tactical - Playable World Model Roadmap

## 🌌 Core Vision

**Real World Tactical** is a play-to-earn tactical shooter that doubles as the world's first commercial playable world model.

### The World Model Architecture
- **Players**: Earn money by completing missions in photorealistic real-world environments
- **AI Companies**: Buy structured human decision-making data to train world models  
- **Real Estate/Enterprise**: Convert spaces into interactive training grounds
- **The Vision**: "Every mission is more than a game—it's a data point in the evolution of AI understanding the real world"

### Demis Hassabis Connection
This is not just a pipeline—it's the skeleton of a world model: **perception** (NeRF), **interaction** (Unity), **adaptation** (AI/ML), and **reinforcement** (missions/rewards). Like Veo 3 learned physics from YouTube, our system learns tactics from humans in simulation.

- **Social Interactions**: Teamwork, betrayal, cooperation = emergent culture

**Demis Connection**: These are the learnable patterns in nature—exactly what he argues neural nets can model.

## ⚔️ The New Pitch (Demis-style)

**"Real World Tactical is not just a game—it's the first commercial world model. A system where humans and AI co-evolve in real-world environments, generating the datasets that will train tomorrow's AGI."**

### The Experience Layer (Crazy Factor)
- **Soundtracks**: Dynamic adaptive scores (tense strings under stealth, tribal drums under firefights, synthwave in future maps)
- **Scenes**: Every mission auto-generates a cinematic replay, turning play into narrative (a Netflix series written by data)
- **Free Will**: No two missions unfold the same → infinite playability

### The World Model Vision
This isn't just a pipeline—it's the skeleton of a world model: **perception** (NeRF), **interaction** (Unity), **adaptation** (AI/ML), and **reinforcement** (missions/rewards). Like Veo 3 learned physics from YouTube, our system learns tactics from humans in simulation.
