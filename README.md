# 🎮 Real World Tactical - Playable World Model

> **The world's first commercial playable world model** - A play-to-earn tactical shooter that doubles as a behavioral data collection system for AI training.

## 🌌 Core Vision

**Real World Tactical** is not just a game—it's the first commercial world model. A system where humans and AI co-evolve in real-world environments, generating the datasets that will train tomorrow's AGI.

### The World Model Architecture
- **Players**: Earn money by completing missions in photorealistic real-world environments
- **AI Companies**: Buy structured human decision-making data to train world models  
- **Real Estate/Enterprise**: Convert spaces into interactive training grounds
- **The Vision**: "Every mission is more than a game—it's a data point in the evolution of AI understanding the real world"

## 🧠 Data as World Knowledge

### Human Behavior Patterns (World Model Training Data)
- **Player Movement**: Navigation patterns through space = spatial intuition
- **Decision Points**: Branching choices = cognitive bias + survival logic  
- **Stress Responses**: How humans adapt under pressure = intuitive physics of psychology
- **Social Interactions**: Teamwork, betrayal, cooperation = emergent culture

### Behavioral Data Collection
Every player action generates structured data for AI training:
- Movement patterns and spatial navigation
- Decision-making under pressure
- Tactical choices and strategy
- Social interaction patterns
- Environmental awareness and adaptation

## 💰 Monetization Model
